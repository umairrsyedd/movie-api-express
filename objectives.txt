What are we doing

creating a server and listening to request
when we get a home request then we show a page where there is an input where we are asking for a movie name
we then take that movie name and pass it to an api and retrieve the information regarding the api
We then convert the body data into valid json and then search for what we need 
we then display the content of what we have searched by looping over something and the figuring what to display
after that we display the details on a page with all the required content
